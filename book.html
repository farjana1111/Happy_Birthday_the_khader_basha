          Whatever the situation life has been thrown to you, you have always been stood like a rock,
           the road seems rocky, and the distance threatens to tear you apart, I dont know from 
           where you have been getting the strength but you have been the rock infront of your 
           family that no one can hurt them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each passing day reveals a new and better side of you. The more I know
          your beautiful soul, the more I fall for it. I have never seen a guy in this era
          who is supportive to his father, being his left hand in each and every situation
          You even doesn't share your illness to you father as he get worried of you,you keep
          on being silent whe he is angry and you understands and supported you father like no one can
          do it .
        </p>
        <p>
          I got so attached to you because you have never taken anything litely
           about your family members specially when it comes to your Mother & Sister. 
           Not only your family members you have always been their for you female friends 
           that they feel secured and protective when you are around them.
           "You are the protector of ur Sister & mother and loved one."
        </p>
        <p>

          blessing. Your presenceis more valuable for me than all the treasures in
          the universe. I could never have imagined how you could have touched

         Juuu...	&#x1F493; I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to
          share the moment. I miss when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or
          laugh because you wipe my tears and make me laugh even more. I miss
          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those
          comforting memories always and forever in my heart.

          like you is a rare diamond I dearly value. Love you, Khajuu. Words just
